Group Name: Poker, I hardly even know her
## Overview
We want to create a game of Chinese Poker on Processing. A deck of cards is split amongst 4 players, and the first person to get rid of their cards wins. Each card has a strength (int associated with it), with 3 of diamonds being the weakest and the 2 of spades being the strongest. The person with the 3 of diamonds goes first, and can choose the type of cards that can be placed that round. The next person has to play the same combination of cards that are stronger. They keep taking turns until someone places a strong enough card, and the rest of the players fold and the next round starts.
